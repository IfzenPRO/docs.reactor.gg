title: Launching the mod and More Resources
---


Launching the mod is the last step in the [Overall Goals](/docs#overall-goals).


## Launching
The example mod should already be in `BepInEx/plugins`. Launch the game and join freeplay.
You should you name be changed to `:>`!

If there are any issues, you can ask for help on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Zcmsb9UGuq).

:::tip
If you are on Linux, and you don't see the name, remember to add `winhttp` to the
wine configuration overrides, as explained in
[Installing BepInEx](install_bepinex#installing-bepinex). Then BepInEx will start working.
